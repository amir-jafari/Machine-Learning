         <h1>Syntax Considerations for reading the M-Code:</h1>
         <introduction>
            <p>All of the handles to the various objects created in each GUI, as well as data needed to run the GUI, are stored in a main
               structure called S. The fieldnames for handles are in lowercase letters, and the fieldnames for data are in uppercase letters.
               Callback function names are designated with the fieldname of the object to which they correspond, followed by '_call.'  Other
               function names are similarly designated.  For instance, a keypressfcn will end in '_kpfcn' and a buttondownfcn will end in
               '_bdfcn.'  The code of each GUI is generously commented, and subtle points may be examined in the comments (see for example
               the last comment block in GUI_37).  If anything seems unclear, look first in the comments, and if satisfaction is not found
               there feel free to email me.
            </p>
            <p>THE CODE IN THESE FILES IS MEANT TO BE READ, NOT JUST USED!</p>
            <p>Therefore, if there is a need for more elaboration in the comments somewhere, please let me know.</p>
            <p>Simple summaries of the GUIs are given below.  See the help for each individual GUI for more details.  Also see the accompanying
               pdf file for more general comments.

         <p>A uicontrol element is set to be visible and invisible by a checkbox.</p>
         <h2>GUI_4  Explore simple string manipulation.<a name="4"></a></h2>
         <p>A multi-line editbox is created, and its string is added to a listbox by a pushbutton.</p>
         <h2>GUI_5  Explore simple string manipulation and user notification.<a name="5"></a></h2>
         <p>A pushbutton deletes the text in a textbox one character at a time. When the string is empty, the user is notified of this
            fact.
         </p>
         <h2>GUI_6  Explore selection determination.<a name="6"></a></h2>
         <p>Pushing the pushbutton reveals which, if any, of the radiobuttons is currently selected.</p>
         <h2>GUI_7  Explore selection determination and counting.<a name="7"></a></h2>
         <p>Selecting an item from the popup causes the textbox to display the number of times the item has been selected.</p>
         <h2>GUI_8  Explore selection determination for a buttongroup.<a name="8"></a></h2>
         <p>Pushing the pushbutton updates an editbox to display which radiobutton in the uibuttongroup is selected.</p>
         <h2>GUI_9  Explore user notification.<a name="9"></a></h2>
         <p>Pushing the pushbutton causes the GUI to simulate a running process and let the user know this process has not finished.</p>
         <h2>GUI_10  Explore making an image visible and invisible.<a name="10"></a></h2>
         <p>Just setting the axes visible/invisible is not enough!</p>
         <h2>GUI_11  Explore GUI use to stop a FOR loop.<a name="11"></a></h2>
         <p>Pushing the pushbutton causes the FOR loop to stop.  Two different uses of GUIs are explored through the use of two FOR loops
            which the user must activate.
         </p>
         <h2>GUI_12  Explore mouse pointer manipulation.<a name="12"></a></h2>
         <p>Pushing the pushbutton to close the GUI proves to be very difficult.</p>
         <h2>GUI_13  Explore slider and editbox interaction.<a name="13"></a></h2>
         <p>An editbox is used to display and manipulate the current position of a slider.</p>
         <h2>GUI_14  Explore string color control.<a name="14"></a></h2>
         <p>A listbox with strings of different colors is presented.  Pushing the pushbutton prints the user's choice to the command window.</p>

         <p>A single textbox is used to display a running clock.</p>
         <h2>GUI_18  Explore the buttondownfcn for an axes.<a name="18"></a></h2>
         <p>Clicking in the axes creates a random line.  Right-clicking deletes that line.</p>
         <h2>GUI_19  Explore counting and argument detection.<a name="19"></a></h2>
         <p>Pushing either of the pushbuttons causes the total number of pushes and the number of arguments passed to one of their callbacks
            to display.
         </p>
         <h2>GUI_20  Explore popup selection determination.<a name="20"></a></h2>
         <p>Choosing an item from the popup causes the editbox to display the choice.</p>
         <h2>GUI_21  Explore popup selection determination and manipulation.<a name="21"></a></h2>
         <p>Similar to GUI_20, except that the editbox is allowed to select a value from the popup.</p>
         <h2>GUI_22  Explore popup selection determination and manipulation.<a name="22"></a></h2>
         <p>Similar to GUI_21, except that the editbox is allowed to select a value from the popup.  The editbox may also add an item
            to the popup.
         </p>
         <h2>GUI_23  Explore multiple-figure data-passing, and the stacking order.<a name="23"></a></h2>
         <p>An editbox is made which will add a title to a selected figure/axes.</p>
         <h2>GUI_24  Explore multiple-figure data-passing.<a name="24"></a></h2>
         <p>Pushing the pushbutton creates another GUI with only a single editbox. Any string entered into the new editbox is placed into
            the first GUI.
         </p>
         <h2>GUI_25  Explore file selection/manipulation.<a name="25"></a></h2>
         <p>A GUI is made which will list all of the .jpg files in the current directory.  When a file is selected, the data is loaded
            into the base workspace.
         </p>
         <h2>GUI_26  Explore listbox choice restriction.<a name="26"></a></h2>
         <p>Three listboxes are created with the same lists.  The user is not allowed to have any two listboxes show the same choice.</p>
         <h2>GUI_27  Explore pointer location detection and display.<a name="27"></a></h2>
         <p>An axes is created and the current location of the mouse pointer in axes coordinates is displayed as a title.</p>
         <h2>GUI_28  Explore contextmenues and buttondownfcn.<a name="28"></a></h2>
         <p>An axes is created and clicking in the axes plots a point.  Options are available by right-clicking on the axes.</p>
         <h2>GUI_29  Explore multiple figure interaction.<a name="29"></a></h2>
         <p>A slider is created which controls the xlim of a plot.  Closing one figure closes them both.</p>
         <h2>GUI_30  Explore callback strings.<a name="30"></a></h2>
         <p>Same as GUI_29, only the task of controlling the xlim is accomplished through callback strings.</p>
         <h2>GUI_31  Explore multiple interactions among uicontrols.<a name="31"></a></h2>
         <p>A simple calculator is created which features several interactions occurring among uicontrols.</p>
         <h2>GUI_32  Explore exporting data to the base workspace.<a name="32"></a></h2>
         <p>Same as GUI_31, except the GUI can be called with a string argument. This string argument will be the name of a variable created
            in the base workspace when the GUI is closed.
         </p>
         <h2>GUI_33  Explore exporting data to the base workspace.<a name="33"></a></h2>
         <p>Same as GUI_31, except a variable will be created in the base workspace through a contextmenu.</p>
         <h2>GUI_34  Explore image capturing with a printscreen GUI.<a name="34"></a></h2>
         <p>A GUI is created which captures an image of the users desktop.</p>
         <h2>GUI_35  Explore fake tabbed panels.<a name="35"></a></h2>
         <p>A GUI is created with togglebuttons that acts like the tabs on panels.</p>
         <h2>GUI_36  Explore a custom dialog box.  GUI returns data to caller.<a name="36"></a></h2>
         <p>A GUI is created which returns a string to whatever function called it, or the base workspace.</p>
         <h2>GUI_37  Explore string manipulation and nested functions.<a name="37"></a></h2>
         <p>An editbox is created which hides the users strings as asterisks. True or false values are returned depending on if the user
            enters the correct password or not.
         </p>
         <h2>GUI_38  Explore the user of JAVA and focussing issues.<a name="38"></a></h2>
         <p>A simple GUI is created which has a pushbutton.  Normally the pushbutton would retain focus after it has been pushed.  This
            would the require the user to click on the figure in order that the figure's keypressfcn should be accessable. The figure
            is given focus after the button press with the help of JAVA.
         </p>
         <h2>GUI_39  Explore a simple drawing program and image saving.<a name="39"></a></h2>
         <p>A blank palette is created which allows the user to draw whatever is desired.  Right-clicking provides color options.  The
            ability to save the drawing in an image format is provided.
         </p>
         <h2>GUI_40  Explore setting the background of pushbuttons to match an image.<a name="40"></a></h2>
         <p>A GUI is created which has an image as a background.  Several buttons which can be used to manipulate the image blend in with
            the image.
         </p>
         <h2>GUI_41  Explore saving the state of a GUI system.<a name="41"></a></h2>
         <p>Three figures make up a system for the user.  The state of the system may be saved and loaded.</p>
