# Python Lab 1

## Objective

The objective of this first Python Lab is to make participants familiar with common Python operations that are extensively used in deep learning workflows.

### Prerequisites
Before starting with this lab, kindly ensure to execute all the cells in the PythonChapter.ipynb Jupyter Notebook as a preparation for this lab.

## Instructions
Throughout the lab, you will encounter predesigned cells with working code. However, certain cells will have missing code parts indicated with a comment `# TODO`.

Here, you are required to:

1. Study the problem described.
2. Fill in the missing parts of the code to make it functional.

In instances where you are required to complete the TODO tasks, sufficient information and guiding comments have been provided to facilitate your understanding of what each task entails.

If you need to add additional cells, you can utilize the `Insert` menu located at the top of the page.

## Commitment
We believe this lab will be an exciting opportunity to interactively learn and practice Python in the context of deep learning. Hence, we encourage asking questions, experimenting with code, and in-depth exploration!

Please ensure to solve all the 'TO DO' tasks assigned in the notebook for complete learning.
